Test files consist of a list of items, where each item consists of a command line followed by the item content. The content continues until the next command or EOF.
Command lines are prefixed with ### and look like this:
### COMMAND [arguments] The remainder of the line is a comment
The following commands are available:

IGNORE
	The contents of this item are ignored. This is useful for "commenting out" tests.

FILE path
	The contents are written to a file at the specified path.

TEMPLATE template_name
	The contents are stored in-memory for later use. The template contents can be "pasted" into a test using the syntax:
	## template_name

TEST test_name expected_result
	The contents are written to a file called test_name.wl and the compiler is run on that file.
	expected_result can either be an e_compile_error value or "success".
	The test passes if compilation produces expected_result.
