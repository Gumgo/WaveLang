# WaveLang

WaveLang is an audio scripting language for building instruments and effects.

## Building

Build system uses Python 3 and SCons. The code is set up to build/run on Linux but I recently switched the build system over to SCons and haven't added Linux support yet. Sorry!

Required libraries and environment variables:

LLVM: LLVM_ROOT_DIR, LLVM_LIB_DIR_DEBUG, LLVM_LIB_DIR_RELEASE
PortAudio: PORTAUDIO_INCLUDE_DIR, PORTAUDIO_LIB_DIR_DEBUG, PORTAUDIO_LIB_DIR_RELEASE
RtMidi: RTMIDI_INCLUDE_DIR, RTMIDI_LIB_DIR_DEBUG, RTMIDI_LIB_DIR_RELEASE
RapidXML: RAPIDXML_INCLUDE_DIR
